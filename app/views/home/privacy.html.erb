    <h4>At Factlink we have a few fundamental principles:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
      </li>
      <li>
        We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or
        protect our rights.
      </li>
      <li>
        We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our
        services.
      </li>
      <li>
        In our product, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by
        search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these principles. We’ve decided to adopt the privacy policy below
      adapted from the privacy policy of <a href="http://wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress.com</a> and Automattic
      Inc, which they
      graciously made available under a
      Creative Commons Sharealike license.

      please <%= link_to("contact us", about_path) %>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is Feed Forward’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
      websites.

    <h4>Website Visitors</h4>

    <p>
      Like most website operators, Feed Forward collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
      browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
      the date and time of each visitor request. Feed Forward’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
      information is to better understand how Feed Forward’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Feed Forward
      may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
      usage of its website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feed Forward also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
      for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <a href="http://feedforward.me">feedforward.me</a>. Feed
      Forward only discloses logged in user
      and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
      information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators
      of Feed Forward.
    </p>

    <h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

    <p>
      Certain visitors to Feed Forward’s website choose to interact with Feed Forward in ways that require Feed Forward
      to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Feed Forward gathers depends
      on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for at
      <a href="http://feedforward.me">feedforward.me</a> to provide a
      username, name, email address and optionally information they want to share with others like their location. Feed
      Forward collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the
      visitor’s interaction with Feed Forward. Feed Forward does not disclose personally-identifying information other
      than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the
      caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
    </p>

    <h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>

    <p>
      Feed Forward may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Feed Forward may
      monitor the most popular channels on the <a href="http://feedforward.me">feedforward.me</a> site or use spam
      screened by Feed Forward to help identify
      spam. Feed Forward may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Feed Forward does not
      disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
    </p>

    <h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

    <p>
      Feed Forward discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of
      its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that
      (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Feed Forward’s behalf or to provide services available
      at Feed forward’s websites, and
      (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
      <br>
      Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
      using Feed Forward’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Feed Forward will not rent
      or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
      employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Feed Forward discloses potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
      governmental request, or when Feed Forward believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
      protect the property or rights of Feed Forward, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user
      of a Feed Forward website and have supplied your email address, apart of digest emails you might have subscribed
      to, Feed Forward may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just
      keep you up to date with what’s going on with Feed Forward and our products. We primarily use our various product
      blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send
      us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to
      publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Feed Forward
      takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction
      of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
    </p>

    <h4>Cookies</h4>

    <p>
      A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser
      provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Feed Forward uses cookies to help Feed Forward identify and
      track visitors, their usage of Feed Forward website, and their website access preferences. Feed Forward visitors
      who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
      Feed Forward’s website, with the drawback that certain features of Feed Forward’s website may not function
      properly without the aid of cookies.
    </p>

    <h4>Business Transfers</h4>

    <p>
      If Feed Forward, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Feed Forward goes
      out of business, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You
      acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Feed Forward may continue to use your personal
      information as set forth in this policy.
    </p>

    <h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>

    <p>
      Although most changes are likely to be minor, Feed Forward may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in
      Feed Forward’s sole discretion. Feed Forward encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to
      its Privacy Policy. If you have a <a href="http://feedforward.me">feedforward.me</a> account, you should also check your dashboard for alerts to these
      changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance
      of such change.
